# New York City TSS client

## Introduction

New York City TSS is the client implementation for ezsy's TSS wallet.

We build it as a `.so` or   `.a` file which will be used by our ezsy flutter mobile app via dartlang ffi as a flutter plugin.

## Requirement

New York City TSS server is required to interact with the client. It will be hosted in a separate repository.

git clone https://github.com/ezsyfi/NewYorkCity-TSS-client
